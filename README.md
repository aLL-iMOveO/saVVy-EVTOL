# saVVy-EVTOL
This Python code will utilize the All-i framework to create a conceptual model for the Savvy EVTOL 
#To design an EVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft), it is important to consider the power source for the aircraft, the aerodynamics of the aircraft, the weight and balance of the aircraft, and the control systems necessary for maneuvering and landing the aircraft. This requires the use of advanced technology and robotics, such as through the use of sensors, navigation systems, and artificial intelligence.
